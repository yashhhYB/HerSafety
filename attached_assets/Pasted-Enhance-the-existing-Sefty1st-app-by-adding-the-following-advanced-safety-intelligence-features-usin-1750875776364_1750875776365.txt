Enhance the existing Sefty1st app by adding the following advanced safety intelligence features using modern technologies. The app is already built with React + Tailwind (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), Supabase (database), Twilio/Google Maps APIs, and deployed on Vercel or Render.

🧠 🔐 1. Smart Guardian Mode (AI-Powered Behavioral Watchdog)
- Add a toggleable background service that monitors motion, mic, and location data (on permission).
- Trigger SOS if:
  - Voice includes keywords like “help me”, “stop”, “no”
  - Sudden jerky movement or fall is detected
  - Shaking the phone or voice command is used
- Record audio, auto-transcribe using Whisper API, and log to encrypted local storage.
- Panic mode: switch to disguised screen if safe-word (e.g., “calendar”) is spoken.
- Use React Native / Expo sensors (or browser sensor API) for motion and audio monitoring.

🤝 🧭 2. SafeRoute Navigator — Real-time Safer Route Suggestion
- Implement safe routing that avoids high-risk zones using Google Maps Directions API.
- Cross-check route segments with Supabase-stored crime reports and recent incidents.
- Assign a “safety score” to each path, based on time of day, lighting, and distance from police stations.
- Show visual safety heatmaps and offer safer alternate route.
- Allow users to crowd-tag segments as “safe”, “unsafe”, “avoid” anonymously.

🔊 🛰 3. Live Threat Radar + AI Safety Scanner (Inspired by HearShot)
- Create a background service or dashboard that:
  - Pulls live data from police feeds (where available), local news RSS, and emergency APIs
  - Uses Whisper + GPT-4-turbo to summarize or transcribe alerts
  - Visualizes live incidents on a map as pulsing markers
  - Pushes real-time alerts to users within 2km radius
- Add community confirmation system (“still active”, “safe now”) for each alert.
- Summarize current safety mood of the area based on NLP parsing of regional news or public data.
- Cache previous alerts and implement cooldown logic to reduce API costs.

🔐 Ensure all features follow strong privacy:
- Client-side encryption (AES-256) for any media or mic data
- Optional opt-in only for mic/GPS usage
- Anonymous reporting for crowd-sourced feedback
